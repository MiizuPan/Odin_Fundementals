        <h4>Blog Post # 1</h4>
        <p>This first post is about nothing and every       thing I want to talk about. I <em>wish</em> I installed text warp in nvim. I <strong>should</strong> probably get to it cause I keep typing all th way to the right</p>

        <p>Separated paragraph in order to keep it normal looking, and also to test out the <strong>awful</strong> set: wrap of vim, why are you breaking my words like that thats so annoying. How do I set it to wrap full words if they dont fit hm.</p>
