        <ul>

        <li><p>[anchor] tag with [href] value leading to another webpage and a [target] attribute with a value of "_blank" to open in a new tab (by default if the attribute is not there it is set to "_self" which opens in the current tab)</p></li>
        <li><p>[rel] attribute with the value "noopener noreferrer". [rel] is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.</p></li>
        <li><p>noopener valye prevents the opened link gaining access to the webpage it was opened from</p></li>
        <li><p>noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which page or resource it came from (noreferrer has noopener behaviour so you can use it by itself)</p></li>
            <li><p>current browsers provide security if target="_blank" so you may not need to add rel="noopener noreferrer" but for good practice you should</p></li>
